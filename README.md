🔄 Workflow Summary
**Data Loading**
The dataset was loaded and explored to understand its structure and identify any issues (like missing values or incorrect formats).

**Data Preprocessing**
Necessary transformations were applied to clean and prepare the data for modeling, including encoding and splitting into features and target.

**Model Building**
A logistic regression model was trained to perform binary classification based on the input features.

**Evaluation**
The model’s performance was measured using key classification metrics like:

Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1-Score
Confusion Matrix
Visualization
Results were visualized through plots to better understand model performance and predictions.
